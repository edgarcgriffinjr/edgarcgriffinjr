# Hi, Iâ€™m Edgar Griffin

## About Me

I am a Software Engineer that is currently building webapps and creating new projects. I am using React and SCSS mostly at the moment.

## Current Project

Currently working on a web app that was designed by Frontend Mentor. The name of the site is nDesigno and it is a pretty expansive site with multiple pages. It is built to be responsive through all screen sizes and have lots of media.
